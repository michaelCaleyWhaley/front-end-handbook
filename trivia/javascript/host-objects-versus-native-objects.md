# Whats the difference between host objects and native objects?

Native objects are objects that are part of the Javascript language defined by ECMAScript spec such as String, Math, RegEx, Object, Function.

Host objects are provided by the runtime envrionment (browser or Node), such as `window`, `XMLHTTPRequest`.
